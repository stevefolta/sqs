This compiles an sqs script into QBE (if available) or C, then calls QBE or the
C compiler to compile that into a binary.  It's meant more as an example of a
larger (perhaps overly large) sqs script than as anything useful.  The compiled
binary probably won't run *that* much faster than running the script in the
interpreter.  But it does work, so if you really need to build a binary for
some reason...
