This compiles an sqs script into C, then calls the C compiler to compile that
into a binary.  It's meant more as an example of a larger (perhaps overly
large) sqs script than as anything useful.  The compiled binary probably won't
run *that* much faster than running the script in the interpreter.  But it does
work, so if you really need to build a binary for some reason...

It uses the same runtime as the interpreter, so it needs access to the
interpreter sources.  Set $SQS_SOURCE in your environment to point to those
sources.
